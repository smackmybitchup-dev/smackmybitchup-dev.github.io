edit log: Fixed quirk mode problem (solution delete HTML, use audio folder instead)

edit log: I was using HTML wrong, got it back and used a program to stop quirk mode and put audio file in a seperate githubpages repository. ):>@

edit log: Scratch that, I did everything fine it was a github problem, so I switched to soundcloud and re-made the program to use IFRAME.

edit log: Okay since I had to add: --- layout: default --- to get it to add my theme in the _config.yml so jekyll would recognize it.
